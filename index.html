            Parking Fine - Project Summary
          </h1>
          <p>
            Parking Fine was my final and most involved User Experience project
            I took on before receiving my degree from UCSD.
          </p>
          <p>
            My group documented the project while we developed our product so we
            could more easily keep track of its scope and remind ourselves of the
            stakeholders involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            We created several personas which helped us organize stakeholders'
            priorities and identify their respective breakdowns.
          </p>
          <img class="infoImg" src="./images/Persona1.png">
          <img class="infoImg" src="./images/Persona3.png">
          <img class="infoImg" src="./images/Persona2.png">
          <p>
            Much of the work included ideation and subsequent prototyping:
          </p>
          <img class="infoImg" src="./images/KioskSketch.jpg" >
          <img id="PamphletSketch" class="infoImg" src="./images/PamphletSketch.png">
          <img class="infoImg" src="./images/KioskSketch2.jpg">
          <p>
            Our work largely consisted of interviewing various stakeholders to
            analyze trends and determine where there were the greatest breakdowns
            in our area of interest, namely, the parking system on campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            During our research we discovered that there was a major disconnect
            between the users - people parking at UCSD, which consisted of students,
            professors, administration, and community members - and the parking
            & traffic department itself. We found that many people weren't
            sufficiently knowledgeable about the campus parking rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, we set out to address this breakdown through redesigning and
            streamlining outdated, disorganized, and inefficient channels of information,
            specifically the UCSD parking website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our collaboration with the head of the parking department lead us to
            design kiosks which, if put into actual production, would be placed
            in parking lots throughout campus that contained more organized and
            readable information, through the accessible medium of paper pamphlets
            and a User Interface on the kiosks themselves.
          </p>
          <img class="infoImg" src="./images/Pamphlet1.png" >
          <img class="infoImg" src="./images/Pamphlet2.png" >
          <img class="infoImg" src="./images/KioskFinal.png" >
          <p>
            Our final design was a product that all aforementioned stakeholders
            were pleased with!

        <div id="info2" class="info">
          <h1>
            NewsFlash - Project Summary
          </h1>
          <p>
          NewsFlash was a project I took part in during my final quarter at UCSD.
          The design theme for the class was to design for people who are
          different from ourselves. With this in mind, we set out to create a
          web application that facilitated practice in speed reading for people
          with dyslexia.
          </p>
          <img class="infoImg" src="./images/NewsflashScreenshot.png" >
          <p>
            Our starting point was our interest in research that showed that dyslexics
            are typically much better speed readers than non-dyslexics, and we
            wanted to develop something that could help foster this skill. We
            began with a simple program that took a string of words and flashed
            them at a set frequency that the user could increase or decrease to
            find a comfortable reading speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We expanded this function to draw from google's recent news API so
            as to perform a secondary function of giving readers relevant,
            real world information to practice on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we implemented the capability to create a user profile so
            the user could save articles that they want to return to for further
            practice, set a preferred font, share articles they found interesting,
            and save their preferred word frequency.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project allowed me to practice both front and back-end web development,
            and familiarized me with how to use databases and APIs.

            Gymtel - Project Summary
          </h1>
          <p>
            Gymtel was a project that I took on in order to both
            encourage people who may have never gone to the gym to start going, and to
            make sure people exercise safely, regardless of skill level.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wrote the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the web app, and
            researched & implemented methods of keeping track of user preferences
            so the user could return to the app and feel comfortable continuing
            its use. This included things like different color themes, and setting
            a user profile picture.
          </p>

        My Experience In User/Human Centered Design
      </h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I graduated from University of California San Diego in 2019 with a
          bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science with Specialization in Human
          Computer Interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's a mouthfull, I know.
        </p>
        <p>
          My schoolwork largely involved working with other students to identify
          breakdowns that people encounter in their daily lives, and develop
          solutions to address those problems over the course of the class quarter.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the solutions we developed were ideated from real world research
          of the actual people we were developing for. Much of our work used the
          concept of Human Centered Design; we would sit down with people, talk to
          them, and observe them working in the environments relevant to our projects
          in order to figure out a solution that worked best for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would then look over our data together and brainstorm ideas that could
          potentially address any breakdowns our people of interest were experiencing.
          These ideas then became prototypes, which we iterated repeatedly, constantly
          refining our product (which was sometimes software, a website, or a physical
          object) until we ended up with a final version that we were proud of and
          felt would best improve the lives of people we were designing for.
        </p>

          The Takeaway
        </h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            Currently, the world is in need of more Human Centered Design. My mission
            is to find ways to make life better for everyone, and I want to find others
            who feel similarly. I strive to help make improvements on current designs
            and create new designs where they are needed to address the needs of
            as many stakeholders as possible. Everyone is important; everyone needs design.
