          This website is a showcase of projects I've both contributed to and
          created entirely by myself. Consider it an archive of lessons and
          skills I've learned through UX design.

          The menu button on the top left will show you a list of UX projects I
          have taken on, as well as detailed analyses of what I learned from
          them as a designer.

      &lt;My Experience In User/Human Centered Design&gt;
    </h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        I graduated from University of California San Diego in 2019 with a
        bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science with Specialization in Human
        Computer Interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's a mouthfull, I know.
      </p>
      <p>
        My schoolwork largely involved working with other students to identify
        breakdowns that people encounter in their daily lives, and develop
        solutions to address those problems over the course of the class quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the solutions we developed were ideated from real world research
        of the actual people we were developing for. Much of our work used the
        concept of Human Centered Design; we would sit down with people, talk to
        them, and observe them working in the environments relevant to our projects
        in order to figure out a solution that worked best for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would then look over our data together and brainstorm ideas that could
        potentially address any breakdowns our people of interest were experiencing.
        These ideas then became prototypes, which we iterated repeatedly, constantly
        refining our product (which was sometimes software, a website, or a physical
        object) until we ended up with a final version that we were proud of and
        felt would best improve the lives of people we were designing for.
