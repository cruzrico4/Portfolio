              Parking Fine - Project Summary
            </h1>
            <p>
              Parking Fine was my final and most involved User Experience project
              I took on before receiving my degree from UCSD.
            </p>
            <p>
              My group documented the project while we developed our product so we
              could more easily keep track of its scope and remind ourselves of the
              stakeholders involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              We created several personas which helped us organize stakeholders'
              priorities and identify their respective breakdowns.
            </p>
            <img class="infoImg" src="../images/Persona1.png">

            <img class="infoImg" src="../images/Persona2.png">
            <p>
              Much of the work included ideation and subsequent prototyping:
            </p>
            <img class="infoImg" src="../images/KioskSketch.jpg" >
            <img id="PamphletSketch" class="infoImg" src="../images/PamphletSketch.png">
            <img class="infoImg" src="../images/KioskSketch2.jpg">
            <p>
              Our work largely consisted of interviewing various stakeholders to
              analyze trends and determine where there were the greatest breakdowns
              in our area of interest, namely, the parking system on campus.
            </p>
            <p>
              During our research we discovered that there was a major disconnect
              between the users - people parking at UCSD, which consisted of students,
              professors, administration, and community members - and the parking
              & traffic department itself. We found that many people weren't
              sufficiently knowledgeable about the campus parking rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, we set out to address this breakdown through redesigning and
              streamlining outdated, disorganized, and inefficient channels of information,
              specifically the UCSD parking website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our collaboration with the head of the parking department lead us to
              design kiosks which, if put into actual production, would be placed
              in parking lots throughout campus that contained more organized and
              readable information, through the accessible medium of paper pamphlets
              and a User Interface on the kiosks themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our final design was a product that all aforementioned stakeholders
              were pleased with!

            <h1>
              NewsFlash - Project Summary
            </h1>
            <p>
            NewsFlash was a project I took part in during my final quarter at UCSD.
            The design theme for the class was to design for people who are
            different from ourselves. With this in mind, we set out to create a
            web application that facilitated practice in speed reading for people
            with dyslexia.
            </p>
            <img class="infoImg" src="../images/NewsflashScreenshot.png" >
            <p>
              Our starting point was our interest in research that showed that dyslexics
              are typically much better speed readers than non-dyslexics, and we
              wanted to develop something that could help foster this skill. We
              began with a simple program that took a string of words and flashed
              them at a set frequency that the user could increase or decrease to
              find a comfortable reading speed.
            </p>
            <p>
              We expanded this function to draw from google's recent news API so
              as to perform a secondary function of giving readers relevant,
              real world information to practice on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we implemented the capability to create a user profile so
              the user could save articles that they want to return to for further
              practice, set a preferred font, share articles they found interesting,
              and save their preferred word frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project allowed me to practice both front and back-end web development,
              and familiarized me with how to use databases and APIs.

            <h1>
              Gymtel - Project Summary
            </h1>
            <p>
              Gymtel was a project that I took on in order to both
              encourage people who may have never gone to the gym to start going, and to
              make sure people exercise safely, regardless of skill level.
            </p>

            <p>
              I wrote the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the web app, and
              researched & implemented methods of keeping track of user preferences
              so the user could return to the app and feel comfortable continuing
              its use. This included things like different color themes, and setting
              a user profile picture.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below is a demo of Gymtel, one of my first projects in web design:
